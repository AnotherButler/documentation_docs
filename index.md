# Documentation Docs

Since mbed is an open source environment, our documentation is written by developers, not technical writers. To help you write your documentation, we've prepared a [writing guide](/writing_guide/) (it was supposed to be a short writing guide, but we got a little carried away) and a [publishing guide](/publishing_guide/) (which explains what and how to publish).

We hope you enjoy these guides and find them useful. 

We'll add a style guide later in the year.
