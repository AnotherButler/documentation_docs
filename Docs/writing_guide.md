# How to write a user guide


Welcome to mbed's not-as-short-as-expected writing guide. This guide should help you write your own user documentation. 

It covers:

* [General writing tips](writing_tips.md).

* [Mapping](maps.md) your document for writing and reading.

* [Fleshing out](fleshing_out.md) your map so that people understand you.

* How to [edit yourself](editing.md).

And a few other topics.


<span class="tips">**Tip:** For advice about publishing your documentation, see [the publishing guide](publishing_guide.md). Our style guide is [available here](style_guide.md).</span>
