# Capitalization and punctuation

## Capitalizaion

Capitals are distracting, so when in doubt - don’t use one.

* For headers and titles, use sentence case (only the first letter and proper names are capitalized).

* If you really want to use title case that’s fine. Just <del>remember that some words are only capitalized if they’re at the head of a sentence, even when using title case. These include (but are not limited to): a, an, and, be, for, from (depending on who you ask; I asked the Guardian), in, is, of, off, on, or, the, to, too.</del> use [http://titlecapitalization.com/](http://titlecapitalization.com/).

* When referring to a keyboard key, use the short form and capitalize the first letter of every word in the name: Tab, Del, Enter, Page Up, Num Lock.

* There is a difference between initials and acronyms:

	* Initials: when you pronounce each letter. Do not use spaces or dots between the letters: BLE, API.

	* Acronyms: pronounced as a single word. Capitalize only the first letter and do not add spaces or dots: Nato.

	* LED or Led? Well, people pronounce them both ways, but for now we’ll stick with LED. That means that the article is *an*, not *a* (to fit the pronunciation “el ee dee”).

	* Companies get to name their own stuff and determine its spelling; always follow official spelling, ignoring the rules I just specified. So it’s GATT, not Gatt. Also gif and pdf, not GIF and PDF. What do you care how gif is pronounced? This is a writing guide.

* Do you use a capital letter after a colon? That sort of depends on what follows it. So the easy answer is “if you want, just be consistent”. If you want the complicated answer, google it. Then be consistent.

* Do not use a capital letter after a semicolon.


## Punctuation and the such

Punctuation is the worst problem in many texts: it changes the meaning of a sentence, so if you don’t punctuate correctly you may [end up in a book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Lynne-Truss/dp/0007329067).

The short story: punctuation is here to help the readers. So if a punctuation mark helps - use it. If it doesn’t - don’t use it, because it just clutters up the view. In other words: use the rules as a guideline only; they’re [not that clear-cut](http://xkcd.com/1167/) anyway.

If you want to, you can write an entire readme file with only commas and periods - but I think you'll have less fun. So with that in mind:

* Periods, or full stops: very helpful. Short sentences are easy. But - they give you an odd staccato. Don't overuse.

* In the interest of not using too many periods, there’s a move away from using them inside or at the end of words like eg, etc and ie. You can use them if you really like them, but don’t get confused if you don’t see them.

* Commas are used to give readers a chance to inhale, so if you let the little voice in your head tell you where to put the comma, you should be fine. But be careful: a comma can change the meaning of a sentence, and the little voice in your head may be trolling you (or, like mine, slightly asthmatic).

* Regarding the Oxford Comma: I use it only when it helps clarify the sentence, sticking to the principle of removing unhelpful punctuation.

* The comma after a word like “however” matters - use it correctly. Consider these examples:
	* "However, these are connected to each other” means “these two things are connected, although we told you earlier something that might make you think otherwise”.
 	* "However these are connected to each other” means “no matter how you connected these, there is something else that needs to be done” (this sentence, therefore, is incomplete - your readers now expect an explanation of what they must do).

* The semicolon is the most awesome of the punctuation marks (and Vonnegut will [pardon me](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/17178-here-is-a-lesson-in-creative-writing-first-rule-do)). By all means, use it. [However](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon), please remember that since the semicolon is used to connect ideas, it shouldn’t be followed by a connecting word (conjunction), so no “and”, “but”, “or” etc. If you think the relationship between the parts isn’t clear without a conjunction, change the semicolon to a colon or period and use the conjunction. Also: no capital letter after a semicolon, since you’re not starting a new sentence.

* Exclamation marks are the written equivalent of laughing at your own jokes. Don't.

* Quotes are wrongly used at least half of the time; don’t use them to draw attention to a word or to emphasize anything.

* I encourage you to use colons when you’re introducing things like lists or bits of code. Or as Fowler put it (quoted by [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-c)): “[Use a colon] to deliver the goods that have been invoiced in the preceding words”.

* I love dashes, and probably overuse them. Here’s [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/style-guide/dashes): “Use a dash to introduce an explanation, amplification, paraphrase, particularisation or correction of what immediately precedes it. Use it to gather up the subject of a long sentence. Use it to introduce a paradoxical or whimsical ending to a sentence. Do not use it as a punctuation maid-of-all-work.” (Gowers). In pairs, they can be used more or less like parenthesis.

	Please remember that a dash and a hyphen are not the same: if you put a space on either side, it’s a dash; if you don’t put any spaces, it’s a hyphen; if you put one space, you’re doing it wrong.

* Hyphens:

	* I tend to overuse them, so you might want to listen to someone else ([the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-h)): “Most adverbial phrases do not need hyphens. Never use them after adverbs ending in -ly, eg constantly evolving newspaper, genetically modified food, hotly disputed penalty, wholly owned subsidiary.

		For adverbs that do not end in -ly, use hyphens only when there would be a possibility of ambiguity without one, eg an ill-prepared speech. 

		But phrases such as ever forgiving, near fatal, now defunct, once popular, etc do not need hyphens.

		Exceptions: much and well when used before a noun, eg a much-loved character (but a character who is much loved), a well-founded suspicion (a suspicion that is well founded), etc.”

	* Avoid using them when the word is formed by one word and a short prefix, such as bi-, de- and neo-.

	* But the Guardian warns: “Use re- (with hyphen) when followed by the vowels e or u (not pronounced as "yu"): eg re-entry, re-examine, re-urge. Use re (no hyphen) when followed by the vowels a, i, o or u (pronounced as "yu"), or any consonant: eg rearm, rearrange, reassemble, reiterate, reorder, reread, reuse, rebuild, reconsider, retweet. Exceptions (where confusion with another word would arise): re-cover/recover, re-creation/recreation, re-form/reform, re-sent/resent, re-sign/resign”.

	* Use them in fractions.

	* Switching for a moment to [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/style-guide/hyphens), use them for most words that begin with anti-, counter-, half-, inter-, non- and semi-.

	* Use them to avoid ambiguities: mbed-enabled boards (boards that have mbed bits) and mbed enabled boards (mbed did something to boards) are different sentences. But do note that it's now "mbed Enabled", so you don't need the hyphen to avoid the ambiguity. 

* Use a question mark only when you’re asking a question, not to indicate uncertainty. And please use a proper question, not a statement - those are different constructions in English.

* Don’t use ellipsis... it's almost never useful in a technical text.

* Lists (numbered or bulleted) need a period or question mark at the end. Don’t use a semicolon or comma.

* Where do you put the punctuation mark for a sentence that ends with parentheses? I put it after the parenthesis, always, even though that’s only half-correct. If you want to get into the area of “well, that depends on what goes in the parenthesis”, both of our reference style guides can explain it.

* Please don’t use apostrophes to make plurals. It’s UUIDs, not UUID’s. And it’s dos and don’ts, not do’s and dont’s (and the plural of no is noes).

* To avoid looking funny, don't use the possessive form for an abbreviation, because that puts the apostrophe just where I told you not to put it (the UUID's job is to…). Better to rearrange the sentence to a slightly clunky form (the job of the UUIDs is to…).

* For other uses of apostrophes: if you're confused, reword your sentence so that you no longer have to figure out whether or not you need one. Please note the difference between "rewording" and "just ignoring it".
