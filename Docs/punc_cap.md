# Capitalization and punctuation

## Capitalizaion

Capitals are distracting, so when in doubt - don’t use one.

* For headers and titles, use sentence case (only the first letter and proper names are capitalized).

* Use title case only for the title of an entire document. It's easiest to use [http://titlecapitalization.com/](http://titlecapitalization.com/) (setting: Chicago Manual of Style).

* When referring to a keyboard key, use the short form and capitalize the first letter of every word in the name: Tab, Del, Enter, Page Up, Num Lock.

* There is a difference between initials and acronyms:

	* Initials: when you pronounce each letter. Do not use spaces or dots between the letters: BLE, API.

	* Acronyms: pronounced as a single word. Capitalize only the first letter and do not add spaces or dots: Nato.

	* LED or Led? Well, people pronounce them both ways, but for now we’ll stick with LED. That means that the article is *an*, not *a* (to fit the pronunciation “el ee dee”).

	* Companies get to name their own stuff and determine its spelling; always follow official spelling, ignoring the rules I just specified. So it’s GATT, not Gatt. Also gif and pdf, not GIF and PDF. What do you care how gif is pronounced? This is a writing guide.

* Do you use a capital letter after a colon? That sort of depends on what follows it. So the easy answer is “if you want, just be consistent”. If you want the complicated answer, google it. Then be consistent.

* Do not use a capital letter after a semicolon.
