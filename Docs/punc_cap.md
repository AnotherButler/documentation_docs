# Capitalization and punctuation

## Capitalization

Capitals are distracting, so when in doubt - don’t use one.

* For headers and titles, use sentence case (only the first letter and proper names are capitalized).

* Use title case only for the title of an entire document. It's easiest to use [http://titlecapitalization.com/](http://titlecapitalization.com/) (setting: Chicago Manual of Style).

* When referring to a keyboard key, use the short form and capitalize the first letter of every word in the name: Tab, Del, Enter, Page Up, Num Lock.

* There is a difference between initials and acronyms:

	* Initials: when you pronounce each letter. Do not use spaces or dots between the letters: BLE, API.

	* Acronyms: pronounced as a single word. Capitalize only the first letter and do not add spaces or dots: Nato.

	* LED or Led? Well, people pronounce them both ways, but for now we’ll stick with LED. That means that the article is *an*, not *a* (to fit the pronunciation “el ee dee”).

	* Companies get to name their own stuff and determine its spelling; always follow official spelling, ignoring the rules I just specified. So it’s GATT, not Gatt. Also gif and pdf, not GIF and PDF. What do you care how gif is pronounced? This is a writing guide.

* Do you use a capital letter after a colon? That sort of depends on what follows it. So the easy answer is “if you want, just be consistent”. If you want the complicated answer, google it. Then be consistent.

* Do not use a capital letter after a semicolon.

## Hacking punctuation

Punctuation has a long usage history (I can lend you a book; please form an orderly queue). Right now, we say that punctuation has a semantic role: it’s here to break writing down into logical units by building fences around each unit. The problem is that punctuation is subjective, so your punctuation makes perfect sense to you, but not necessarily to others. 

### Subjective punctuation

Why? Here’s an alarmingly oversimplified explanation of humans: we have an inner voice that affects what we read and tells us what to write. One of the things that make our inner voice unique is the way it punctuates. For some people it’s a flowing run-on voice that likes the smoothness of long sentences, for others it's very short sentences. This difference isn't logical - it's musical. 

So your instinct is probably to punctuate musically more than logically. Now come your readers; each one has a different inner voice that responds differently to your punctuation. If your punctuation were 100% logical, this wouldn't be a problem. But it's musical, and your inner stresses and rhythms aren't the same as your readers'. Crucially, they aren't likely to be obvious from your punctuation, either - partially because you mix in some logical punctuation, partially because you don't need to punctuate most of your inner voice for it to make sense to you. So now your punctuation isn't consistently logical and isn't transparently musical. 
  
What all this means for technical writing (don’t come at me with your creative or academic writing style guide) is that if you want people to understand you, you need to suppress your inner voice's musicality. Use punctuation to give your readers' inner voice the tools to separate and connect your *logical* units. 

In short, you need to think of the logic of what you’re saying, then punctuate a fence around it. Your punctuation should then be more objective, which will help it fill its semantic role.

### Objective punctuation

Think of punctuation as having a hierarchy, based on the type of logical unit – topic, idea, some extra bit of information – and its relationship to other units.

#### Topic

A **paragraph**. Yes, a paragraph break is a kind of punctuation. 

#### Idea

A sentence. If you have two ideas, you need two sentences. You combine ideas about a topic – two or more sentences – into a paragraph (but it’s okay sometimes to have a one-sentence paragraph). 

The main sentence indicator is a **period** (or **full stop**), which you don’t use nearly as often as you should. **Question marks** and **exclamation marks** also count, but please minimize their use. 

#### Some extra bit of information

This is where it gets messy:

* **Comma:** the punctuation mark most likely to get you into trouble. Simplifying yet again: it separates the main part of a sentence from its supporting actors. For example, it separates “for example” – a sort of interjection – from the part of the sentence that provides the actual example. It also separates items in a list, but you knew that one already. For more info, see below.

* **Semicolon:** is in reality a semi*period* . It’s used to connect two sentences (unlike a comma, which separates two parts of a single sentence). The semicolon implies a relationship between the two sentences, which means that it’s used instead of conjunctions (“and”, “but”, “or”, “for”) and often precedes a conjunctive adverb (“however”, “indeed”, “therefore”). Many of you avoid the semicolon, but replace it with a comma rather than a period; this is wrong.

* **Dash:** it’s easiest to think of it as separating a sentence and some comment on that sentence – an explanation, paraphrase, particularization, correction or contradiction (funny or otherwise).

* **Parenthesis:** break off the bit of a sentence that no one will actually miss if it jumped off a cliff. So if you don’t mind something falling off a cliff, put it in parenthesis; if you’d actively push it off that cliff, delete it.

* **Colon:** is in some sense actually the end of a sentence, but without being the end of an idea. In technical writing, it’s best to use it only before a list or an example.

Yes, these are all horribly simplified. But since we’re dealing with technical writing, not poetry, it’s okay to use simplified punctuation. It’s better than okay. 

### Summary

When communicating technical information, think of punctuation in a very technical way: "punctuation mark, bit of logic, punctuation mark". Limit yourself to the most basic use of each mark, and when in doubt – start a new sentence.

Now, here's a distinction that will become even more obvious as you read on: while you shouldn't punctuate according to musicality, it's impossible to ignore the fact that any punctuation mark, however logically placed, *will* affect the musicality of your sentence. So while you might try to punctuate objectively, the reading will always be subjective.

## The comma

The comma comes between two parts of a single sentence (not between two sentences; that’s the semicolon). The tricky thing about the comma is that it has two main roles (and a couple of supporting roles), and sometimes they contradict each other. This is, again, a question of semantics v musicality; the advice above - to favor logic above musicality - isn't easy to implement when it comes to commas. You have to carefully check whether your comma is there because it makes sense, or because your inner voice wanted a pause.

### Role one: semantics

The comma’s semantic role signals to the reader which part of the sentence he’s reading right now. For example, commas are commonly used to separate the unnecessary part of the sentence from the necessary part:

>“Hamsters who understand the rules of punctuation are eaten by zombies.” 

There’s a subset of hamsters that is eaten by zombies, probably because punctuation-loving hamsters are annoying. If I remove “who understand the rules of punctuation” I make the sentence false, because it then implies that all hamsters are eaten by zombies. 

>“Rabbits, who understand which fork to use when, are eaten by zombies.” 

All rabbits are eaten by zombies because all rabbits are annoying. If I remove “who understand which form to use when” the sentence remains true – just less informative.

And that’s one definition for what you put between commas: *something that can be removed without making the sentence false*. The commas (or comma and period) work like parentheses in this case – you need to trap your phrase between two of them. If you use just one, you’re changing the meaning of the sentence (by not defining where each part starts or ends). So your options are:

* Put the words between two commas: “That’s true of some vampires, like the ones from Sesame Street, but not all bats.”
* Put the words between a comma and a period: “That’s true of some vampires, like the ones from Sesame Street.”

Another semantic role you can flag is an *interjection or comment*. For example, “for example” is followed by a comma. Here, too, you’re separating the heart of the sentence from a not-completely-necessary part. Although it helps the reader to know that they're now reading an example, the sentence remains true (is still an example) even if you remove the words “for example”.

### Role two: music

The second role of the comma is to control the flow of the sentence; more a musical notation than an aid to understanding:

>“For a long while I have believed – this is perhaps my version of Sir Darius Xerxes Cama’s belief in a fourth function of outsideness – that in every generation there are a few souls, call them lucky or cursed, who are simply born not belonging, who come into the world semi-detached, if you like, without strong affiliation to family or location or nation or race; that there may even be millions, billions of such souls, as many non-belongers as belongers, perhaps; that, in sum, the phenomenon may be as “natural” a manifestation of human nature as its opposite, but one that has been mostly frustrated, throughout human history, by lack of opportunity. 
>
>— Salman Rushdie, The Ground Beneath Her Feet

That’s prose, and in terms of punctuation it’s as far away as you can get from technical writing without tripping over James Joyce. 

As we said above, this isn't a good technique for technical writing. You're not trying to create an atmosphere - you're trying to communicate complex information in a simple way. Musical punctuation can only get your readers into trouble; some slower readers will not be able to parse the Rushdie quote.

### The problems with the musical role of the comma

Here’s an example. And I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to explain a grammatical concept now: the independent clause. An independent clause is part of a sentence, but it can function as its own sentence. A comma on its own doesn't connect two independent clauses in English, so using it is confusing to your readers, because you're flagging a wrong semantic relationship (by implying that the second clause is not independent): 

>**Bad:** “It’s nearly four in the morning, we can ambush the milkman.” 

The comma is here because of the sound of the sentence: in speaking, most people will put a short pause before “we”. When writing, they therefore look for the standard “pause” mark – the comma – and shove it in. But it’s connecting two independent clauses, so it’s not okay.

>**Good:** 
>* Use a semicolon: “It’s nearly four in the morning; we can ambush the milkman” 
>* Use a comma and a connecting word: “It’s nearly four in the morning, so we can ambush the milkman”.

### The problem with the semantic role of the comma

The problem with going full-logic is that it leads to some ugly, hard-to-read sentences. You can't ignore the way something sounds when you punctuate. But the answer isn't to ignore the semantic role of your punctuation; it's to choose the punctuation mark - or sentence structure - that will give you good flow as well as good semantics. 

Here’s another example. This time the commas are semantically correct, and it’s the rhythm of the sentence that suffers:

> **Bad:** “You don’t, I think, when all is said and done, have to consider hamsters, which are obviously just snacks, an important part of a zombie’s diet.”
>
> **Good:** “You don’t have to consider hamsters, which are obviously just snacks, an important part of a zombie’s diet.” 
 
You’ll note that I dropped parts of the sentence. If you’re using lots of commas, you should take that as a hint that your sentence has gone horribly wrong. Cut it to smaller sentences, drop some words, or do both.
