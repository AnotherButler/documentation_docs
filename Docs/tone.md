# Establishing the right tone

Your goal is to write something readers will be proud to share with their colleagues and their boss. Better - your writing should be something a boss will send everyone as "you should really read this". Take an honest look at your document - would you be proud to have your boss catch you reading it? If not, you need to change your tone.

Think of the scientist you like listening to the most. They might be a doctor, a physicist or a biologist. What do they do that makes you listen - sometimes more than once - to a talk?

First, they clearly know what they're talking about and talk only about what they know. They're not guessing, or hiding their ignorance behind vague language. Either they know or they don't, and they say so. This establishes trust. 

Second, they don't talk down to you, but they also don't start the conversation at a PhD level. They explain things clearly: all the facts in plain words, a couple of examples or metaphors to help solidify it in your mind. They don't insult you for not knowing something, or tell you that you're too ignorant to be listening to them.

Last, although they use plain words, they don't use unprofessional language; very little slang, no phrases that listeners will associate with high-school students, no attempts to hype up their science with overzealous marketing-speak and jargon.

This doesn't mean they don't have a sense of humor. Some of them could probably have had a successful comedy career. But they're never childish or rude, and they never give you the feeling they're insulting *you*. Their humor is sharp wit, directed at physics or biology, not at people. 

So when you write, try to imagine this scientist reading your text. Doesn't work? Then change your text until, suddenly, it sounds like one of your favorite talks.
