# Writing an instruction

## In general

* Don't say an option *enables* or *allows* x, because that implies not that x will be performed, but that x is now available for selection. Unless that’s what you meant, of course.

* Talk to the reader: "you can select your..." etc. Never use the third person; you'll sound like a creepy lawyer.

* You can use “we” instead of “you”, if you like (but I prefer "you" - it prevents confusion). “We” is seen as friendlier, as if you’re going through this with the reader, rather than watching from the sidelines.

* In instructions, processes and so on use the present tense whenever possible. “Click X. A window opens.” and not “A window will open”. 

* Try to use positive rather than negative sentences. Users (even when they’re reading) expect positive actions (“do x”, not “don't do y”) and might work based on that expectation (without bothering to read the whole sentence, of course).

* When texts are related (such as bulleted lists), try to make them very similar, so that the differences stand out; this helps readers scan the text and pick out the differences, rather than read the whole text. If part of the text of all options is identical, it should be moved to the section label, rather than be used again and again in every option.


## Single and multi-step instructions

If you're giving a one-step instruction, you just write "x to y". So:

> "Select Compile > Update Docs to regenerate the program documentation".

Or "for y, do x":

> "To regenerate the program documentation, select Compile > Update Docs".

If you have more than one step, start with the expected result, then the steps as a numbered list ("for y, do x"). So it's:

> "To create a new program:

> 1. Select New > New Program to open the Create New Program window.

> 2. Another action.

> 3. You get the point."

Fun fact (it's not a fact, just a preference): we use bullets if a list can come in any order and numbers if the list can only come in the order in which it's presented. Instructions will therefore tend to be numbered.

It's better to tell people what they should do, not what they shouldn't do. If you're worried about damage to hardware: add a warning, then be as negative as you want. Note that warnings are not a step in the instructions; they're a formatted paragraph before all steps or before the relevant step. The formatting should stand out from the list, but not be too jarring.

## Buttons and keys

* Use “click” for something in a GUI (like the compile button).

* Use “press” for a physical button or key (like the power button on the boards, or keyboard keys).

* When giving keyboard shortcuts: give the short form with a capital letter: Del, Cmd.

* If more than one key is required, use **+** without spaces: Ctrl+Alt+Del.

* When talking about on-screen buttons: If the button has a name (written on it) you can refer to it directly with a capital letter, and you can also use bold font if you want: “click **Compile**”. But if there’s just an icon, it’s best to use a few more words: “click the search button” (no capital, and using an article, because there’s no name for the button).

* You select and clear radio buttons and checkboxes.
