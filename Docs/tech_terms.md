# Technical terms

* Runtime (one word).

* Microcontroller (one word).

* Online (one word).

* internet, but Internet of Things.

* Read/write, despite my habit of separating them.

* Silicon. If you add an E at the end, you’re in the wrong industry (you could be earning loads more).

* sim, not SIM. Many people object to this; go with SIM if you prefer.

* I have no idea where the word breadboardable came from, but I love it.

* Wap (note the W, not w) phones.

* world wide web, despite worldwide usually being one word. Cause it’s English, that’s why.

* Wi-Fi or WiFi. Pick one, I give up (but I'll give you a hint: the alliance is Wi-Fi).

* Ethernet, not ethernet.

* micro-USB, but if you really want Micro-USB you can roll with it.

* Smartphone, smartwatch (one word).

* Point-to-point, with all those hyphens.

* It’s possible, so we’ll go with it, that “plug and play” is the technology, and any other spelling is either wrong or a brand name. So use plug and play, not Plug And Play, Plug’N’Play or anything like that.

* Normally (by which I mean - when I write) we use “press” for a physical button or key (like the power button on the boards, or keyboard keys) and “click” for something on the screen (like the compile button).

* If the button has a name (written on it) you can refer to it directly (with the capital letter, and you can also use bold font if you want): “click **Compile**”. But if there’s just an icon, it’s best to use a few more words: “click the search button” (no capital, and using an article, because there’s no name for the button).

* Downstream.

* Program (for software; it’s programme in every other context).

* You select and clear radio buttons and checkboxes.

* Memory map, not memory-map. But the adjective is hyphenated: memory-mapped.

* flash memory, not Flash memory.

* Laptop (one word).

* BlackBerry and BlackBerrys, not berries.

* If you’re using someone else’s stuff specify it on first mention. Link to it, too; it’s the polite thing to do.

* Services and Profiles or services and profiles? That depends on context. If you’re talking about a specific profile or service and giving its full name, it’s probably Profile or Service. If you’re talking about the general concept, or if you’re referring to a previously-mentioned profile or service without giving the full name again, it’s profile or service.

* Boot loader, not bootloader. Not everyone agrees with me on this, so you can ignore me.

* GATT, despite the fact that it’s pronounced Gatt.

* SoftDevice.

* FOTA (not FOtA).

* LED (although many people pronounce it like the past tense of lead). The article is an, not a, since we assume people pronounce it “el ee dee”.

* mKIT.

* High frequency and low frequency (no need for a hyphen).

* High power and low power (probably).

* Power up and power down (not on and off) for the verbs. Powerup and powerdown for the nouns.

* I/O (not IO).

### Processors

You can only use processor names as adjectives or adverbs. For example, refer to the ARM926EJ-S processor, not the ARM926EJ-S.
