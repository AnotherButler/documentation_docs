# Documentation Guides

Since mbed is an open source environment, our documentation is written by engineers, not technical writers. To help you write your documentation, we've prepared:

* A [writing guide](writing_guide.md) (it was supposed to be a *short* writing guide, but we got a little carried away). It tells you what to write and how to choose and structure your content. 
* A [style guide](style_guide.md). It advises on clear and concise writing.
* A [publishing guide](publishing_guide.md). It explains what and how to publish.
