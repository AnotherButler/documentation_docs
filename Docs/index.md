# Documentation Docs

Since mbed is an open source environment, our documentation is written by our community, not (just) ARM technical writers. We've written a [publishing guide](publishing_guide.md), which explains what and how to publish on docs.mbed.com; we strongly encourage you to publish documentation of your projects.
