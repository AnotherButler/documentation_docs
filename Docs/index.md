# Documentation Docs

Since mbed is an open source environment, our documentation is written by developers, not technical writers. To help you write your documentation, we've prepared a [writing guide](/writing_guide/) (it was supposed to be a *short* writing guide, but we got a little carried away), a [style guide](/style_guide/) and a [publishing guide](/publishing_guide/) (which explains what and how to publish).

We hope you enjoy these guides and find them useful. 


Okay, link formats when the files are all in the same folder:

[../Docs/writing_guide.md](../Docs/writing_guide.md) - only one that works on GitHub, doesn't work on Mkdcos

[/writing_guide/](/writing_guide/) - only one that works on Mkdcos, doesn't work on GitHub

[../writing_guide.md](../writing_guide.md) - doesn't work anywhere

[/Docs/writing_guide/](/Docs/writing_guide/) - doesn't work anywhere
