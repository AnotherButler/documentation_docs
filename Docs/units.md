Units of measurement


* Remember the good ol’ days when computer terms were set by computer people? Well, those days are over. [So now KB, MB and GB mean “1,000”](https://xkcd.com/394/). A nice, round number, to be sure, but missing the sciency feel of two to the power of ten.

	If you want to say 1,024 you’ll now have to use KiB, MiB and GiB.

* b == bit.

* B == byte.

* MB/s (megabyte), Mb/s or Mbps (megabit).

* Gb == gigabits.

* GB == gigabytes.

* 𝜇A == microamps.

* W watts, kW kilowatts, mW miliwatts, MW megwatts.

* J joules, kJ kilojoules.

* Hz, MHz.

* dB for decibel.

* The short form of minutes is min, not m (because m stands for meter).

* But seconds is s, not S.

* When talking about signal states, it's HIGH and LOW. I also like TRUE and FALSE for binaries.
