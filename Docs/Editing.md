# Editing yourself

This is one of the hardest things you have to do in writing. Editing yourself requires spotting your own mistakes, but since you know what you meant to say it's hard to realize you didn't actually say it. It's even harder to spot a typo or misspelling, because you often see the word as you expect it to be, not as you've written it.

## Editing a complete text

Some tips:

* Read very slowly. This will help you spot typos that you gloss over when you're reading quickly. It will also help you get a feel for how your text reads to slower readers (like many non-native readers).

* Focus on order: did you put the information (even within a single paragraph) as A to Z, or do you go from C to B via R without passing through A? And did you make the relationship between the different bits clear?

* Try to spot leaps of knowledge. Where did you require more information than the reader is likely to have? Where did you think a connection between two concepts you introduced is intuitive? It isn't.

* Try to spot ambiguous sentences. You're writing in English, so you should be able to find plenty of them. But it's hard work to find them in your own writing, since you know what the sentence should mean so you'll not fall for the ambiguity. You have to force yourself to check if your word choice, or word order, can give the sentence two meanings that are not clarified by the context. You can read more about this in our [style guide](words.md#ambiguity).

## Editing as you write

It's the same as editing when you're done, only less effective. In general, the longer the break between writing and editing, the better the edit.

## Backwards editing

Anyone who writes a long document without ever going back and revising what they have already written is not paying attention. But - when you realize you need to edit something, try to make a note of it and get back to it later, not as soon as you think about it; rushing off to edit it will make you lose the thread you're working on.
