# How to Publish mbed Documentation

This guide is intended for developers who are trying to add documentation to their projects. It details the tools we use (GitHub, docs.mbed.com and Markdown) and the scope of documentation.

For advice about writing your documentation, see [the writing guide](writing_guide.md).

## What to Publish

Documentation about:

1. New things. 

2. Changes to existing things.

2. Deprecations. 

In other words: when you create a repository, or when you edit the code in an existing one, please create (or edit) documentation.

## Using GitHub and Markdown

Our documentation is written in Markdown and lives on GitHub:

1. [Here's a summary of GitHub flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

2. Your docs should sit in the same GitHub repository as the code. So if you have a repo at github.com/ARMmbed/repo, you have two options:

	* Put an MD file in the root (https://github.com/ARMmbed/repo/readme.md).

	* Create a directory for your file (https://github.com/ARMmbed/repo/doc/readme.md). 

3. Feel free to create more than one MD file. But you should probably have readme.md as the main, because most people will look at it first. Then you can add files like API.md, changelog.md and depricated.md.

## docs.mbed.com

Documentation living on GitHub can be published on [docs.mbed.com](http://docs.mbed.com) using your mbed account:

- Log into docs.mbed.com with your **developer.mbed.org** credentials.

<span style="background-color: #F0F0F5; text-align:center;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px;">![Logging in](Images/DocsLogin.png)</span>

- You are taken to your dashboard.

- Click **Import a Project**.

<span style="background-color: #F0F0F5; text-align:center;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px;">![Import](Images/Import.png)</span>

- You have two importing options. Click **Manually Import Project**.

<span style="background-color: #F0F0F5; text-align:center;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px;">![Manually import](Images/ManuallyImport.png)</span>

- Name your project and enter the GitHub repo URL.

<span style="background-color: #F0F0F5; text-align:center;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px;">![Project details](Images/ProjectDetails.png)</span>

- Review the other options. The default values may well be all you need.

- Click **Next**. You are taken to the project page.

- The project tries to build a first version as soon as it's created. Click **Builds** to see the build's progress. 

<span style="background-color: #F0F0F5; text-align:center;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px;">![Project home page](Images/ProjectHome.png)</span>

* When the build is done, you can click **View Docs** to see your project. 

* Your project's Admin page allows adding tags to your projects (as comma-seperated words). Tags help users find your documents, so we recommend using them.

<span style="background-color:#E6E6E6;border:1px solid #000;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px">
**Tip**: docs.mbed.com uses the [Mkdocs engine](http://www.mkdocs.org/). Read [their documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started) to learn about more options.</span>
