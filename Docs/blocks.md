# Writer's blocks aren't just for fiction writers

Got writer's block? Trying to edit yourself but keep reverting back to the original? Not to worry - generations of writers have successfully dealt with these same issues with little more than these helpful tips:

* Look away from the text for a while: work on something else, take a walk, make a cup of tea.

* Put bits of your text through Google Translate a few times. It should give you an interesting view of it (and a good giggle).

* Move to a different part of the text. 

* Try explaining it out loud to someone. They don't actually have to pay attention.

* Listen to a song you like for its lyrics or to a lecture or podcast. 

* Read something. Anything, on any topic.

* If you're bilingual, write or read in your other language. It can be either the same piece you're blocked on, or a completely different topic.

* Talk to yourself. Type it out, but don't worry about *writing*. Just talk it through.

* Spit it out, no matter how bad it is. You can edit later. Note: I don't approve of this method, because I think a first draft stays with you forever; it influences all future edits, no matter how bad it is.
