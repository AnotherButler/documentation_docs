# General Writing tips

* Don’t use more words than you need - some poor soul has to read them all.

* You get no extra credit for using long or obscure words - use little ol’ English.

* Don’t let your sentences run away from you - keep them short and simple.

* If you have a sense of humour - use it. In a pinch, [link](http://xkcd.com/1348/) [to](http://xkcd.com/195/) [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/386/).

* Technical writing should convey facts, not scatter confetti. If a sentence doesn't include at least one fact, it's probably a waste of the reader's time. Unless it's a joke, because giving people a break and a reason to smile helps them deal with text.

## A final word of warning

Do not leave your own notes in the text when you publish it, especially if you tend to be less than entirely polite when talking to yourself (and your collaborators). Always preface them with the same bit of text, like TBD or WTH, and do a search on it before publishing.
