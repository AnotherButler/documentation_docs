# About the style guide

A style guide is a collection of fussy complaints about the way people write. It exists because, [in this description of reality, I am the pragmatist](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3761). It covers some vocabulary, grammar, punctuation and style choices that are either good or bad (mostly bad). It is by no means a full guide to the English language, but it should help you think about how you use it and avoid some of the more common mistakes.

Just so that you know I'm not making it up: our style guide is heavily influenced by [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a) and [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction). If you want to read those instead of this one, you're very welcome to. They're more comprehensive and accurate, and much funnier. It is further boosted by [Grammar Girl](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl), [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) and [the Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/). 

The trick with a style guide isn’t to remember the right way of using all of these - it’s to remember that you need to look them up.

## The short version

The underlying rule of this style guide is "be clear", and all** other rules are its elaborations or symptoms.

The first elaboration of this rule is: be clear to non-English speakers. These are people who don't use English in real life, and they don't reach a post-graduate command of it. I'm saying "post-graduate" because that's the level many of you write in. Take it down a notch. You can use the [Hemingway Editor application](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to practice. Aim for high school or lower.

The main symptoms of the clarity rule are:

* Don’t use more words than you need - some poor soul has to read them all.

* You get no extra credit for using long or obscure words - use little ol’ English.

* Don’t let your sentences run away from you - keep them short and simple.

* Technical writing should convey facts, not scatter confetti. If a sentence doesn't include at least one fact, it's probably a waste of the reader's time.

* Be consistent. Don't use the same word to refer to different things.

What the clarity rule *doesn't* demand is obeying odd grammar rules whose sole justification is "Someone said so 200 years ago". If a rule doesn't make your writing clearer, you're free to doubt it. This applies to most Latin-based rules like never ending a sentence with a preposition and not splitting the infinitives. It also applies to many arguments about punctuation. 

One last comment: If you have a sense of humour - use it. In a pinch, [link](http://xkcd.com/1348/) [to](http://xkcd.com/195/) [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/386/).

** Okay, most. Some rules are about aesthetics.

## Learning from our betters

If you’re not sure, follow this emergency procedure:

1. Ask [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a).

2. If that doesn’t work, ask [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction).

3. Note that when those two disagree we follow the Guardian, unless we like the Economist’s advice better.

4. When all else fails, ask Google. Try to remain with fairly recent sources; you don’t want Advice from the Period of English when all Nouns got a Capital.

## A word about American v British English

ARM uses the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/contents) and [Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/). Both of these are in American English (or International English, which follows the American spelling). 

To pick a spelling for a word with two or more commonly used options, go to Merriam-Webster and use the spelling listed first. 

The ARM style guide has a summary of the most consistent differences between British and International English:

* Past and continuous tense of words ending in -l do not use -ll. For example: 
	* Cancelled is canceled. 
	* Cancelling is canceling. 
	* Labelled is labeled. 
	* Labelling is labeling. 

* Words ending in -ise end in -ize. For example:
	* Initialise is initialize. 
	* Customise is customize. 

* Words ending in -yse end in -yze. For example: 
	* Analyse is analyze. 

* Words ending in -our end in -or. For example: 
	* Colour is color. 
	* Behaviour is behavior. 

* Past and past participle tense of words ending in -t end in -ed. For example: 
	* Learnt is learned. 
	* Spelt is spelled. 

* Words ending in -ogue end in -og. 
	* For example: — Dialogue is dialog

## Spelling

* Put all your text into something that can check your spelling. Do not trust yourself.

* Do not trust the spellchecker.

* Okay, that was a bit unfair. If you’re not sure you’ve got the correct spelling, you can do two things: google the spelling you have and see what the dictionary says, or google both forms (“x or y?”) and see if anyone explains the difference. If the only difference is that one is British and one is American, please use American.

* Do not use all-caps unless that is the legal form of a name (so it's ARM, not Arm).
