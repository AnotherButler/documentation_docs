# Documentation Docs

Since mbed is an open source environment, our documentation is written by developers, not technical writers. To help you write your documentation, we've prepared a [writing guide](/Docs/writing_guide.md) (it was supposed to be a *short* writing guide, but we got a little carried away), a [style guide](/Docs/style_guide.md) and a [publishing guide](/Docs/publishing_guide.md) (which explains what and how to publish).

We hope you enjoy these guides and find them useful.
